# Will this work on Windows?

No, sorry. SSH clients on Windows (like PuTTY) format their configuration
differently from the standard SSH config file format used on \*nix platforms.

**UNLESS** you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, of course! Then you
can run this script from inside a WSL terminal just like any other \*nix box.

If this is the case, simply follow the
[installation instructions](index.html#show-me-how).
